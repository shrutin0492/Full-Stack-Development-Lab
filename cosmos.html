        <p class="p1">Cosmology is the study of the universe and its origins, evolution, and eventual fate. It employs various tools and technologies from computer science and robotics to explore and analyze cosmic phenomena.</p>
        <p class="p2">Robotics plays a crucial role in space exploration by designing and building robots that can navigate extraterrestrial environments, collect data, and perform tasks that are too dangerous or impractical for humans.</p>
        <p class="p1">Computer simulations and algorithms developed in computer science enable researchers to model complex cosmological processes, simulate cosmic phenomena, and analyze vast amounts of observational data.</p>
        <p class="p2">In the field of cosmology, advancements in robotics have led to the development of autonomous telescopes, rovers, and spacecraft that can explore distant galaxies, study cosmic radiation, and search for signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>
